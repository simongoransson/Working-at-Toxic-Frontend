## Estimaiton
- Installation & API investigation (1h)
- Design / Implementation (2h)
- Functionality (2h)

## Start the React App in local:
1.  `cd myproject/Working-at-Toxic-Fronten` > `npm start`

### Information
Due to the time lime limit there was some restrictions with design and functionality. Read the section `Future Developments`.

#### TODOS: 
- Add lazyloaders and Skeleton Loaders for the loding parts (containg images and other API Data).
- Add Docker/configuration for easier development and to ensure to always have the same setup.
- For this purpouse i used standard Context PAI instead of redux, could add redux for easier global management.

#### Future Developments
1. Add pagination and add endpoints/query for pagination.
2. Add endppoints for filtering, can be nice to add filtering with the supported endpoimnt query `&sortBy` instead of filtering it manually with vanillia JS.
